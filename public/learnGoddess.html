    <h1 class="h1">A thinkleet married a beautiful maiden he found in northern lands. Even after he told her to stop smiling at people, his wife smiled and gleamed at everyone she saw. Eventually the thinkleet put red birds everywhere to spy on the wife. Enraged by their reports, the thinkleet locks his wife in a wooden box. The thinkleetâ€™s sister begged him to release his wife, so instead he killed her children. The sister travelled away and gave birth to a son who was destined to defeat the thinkleet. The boy grew up and freed the wife; and released a great power that made the world a beautiful place.</h1>
